## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
1. A **Linux machine** with a containerization application like Docker, Podman, or Rancher.
2. Docker is recommended for this setup.

If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions in the **Prerequisites** section to install Docker or another containerization application.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Open the terminal** on your Linux machine.

2. **Run the following Docker command** to start the container with the application:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --network="bridge" -p 3000:5000 sanjaykshebbar/add-board:v2
    ```

    #### Explanation of the Docker command:

    - `docker run`: This command runs a container from a specified image.
    - `-d`: This flag runs the container in the background (detached mode).
    - `--network="bridge"`: This specifies the network mode for the container. The `bridge` network is a default network in Docker, ensuring that the container can communicate with other containers on the same network.
    - `-p 3000:5000`: This flag maps the host machine's port 3000 to the container's port 5000, making the application accessible on port 3000 of your host machine.
    - `sanjaykshebbar/add-board:v2`: This is the name of the Docker image being used. It's a versioned image (`v2`), and this image contains the application code.

3. **Access the application**:
    - Once the container is running, you can access the application via a web browser.
    - Open a browser and enter the following URL to access the app:
    
    ```plaintext
    http://<IP/Hostname>:3000
    ```
    
    This will launch the blank page of the application.

4. **Access the Management Dashboard**:
    - To access the media management dashboard, navigate to the login page:
    
    ```plaintext
    http://<IP/Hostname>:3000/login
    ```
    
    - Enter the following credentials to log in:
      - **Username**: `admin`
      - **Password**: `password`

    After logging in, you will have access to the **media management dashboard**. Here, you can manage the media content, which includes adding or removing media files (MP4 videos and JPG images).

---

### Managing Media:
Once logged in, you can:
- **Upload media**: Add new MP4 or JPG files to the media library.
- **Delete media**: Remove existing media files from the system.

### NOTE:
This tool will automatically fetches the updated media content and get that displayed, where there is no manual intervention needed here.
